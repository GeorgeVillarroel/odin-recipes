        <li>In a wok or an iron pan already hot pour in oil then add the beaten eggs, it'll bubble from the edge. You really should break and scramble the eggs into small bitesize pieces, then set it aside.</li>
        <li>Add oil and fry garlic, and the <strong>white</strong> part of the scallion for 2-3 mins until brown, then put in the rice and toss it constantly to heat the rice evenly, if the rice is in clumps, separate the grains. then cook for 5 mins until rice is fried evenly</li>
        <li>Combine the eggs and season to taste with salt, msg, white pepper, sesame oil, and at last add soy sauce on the pan and <strong>not</strong> on the rice, so the flavour stays uniform</li>
        <li>Then at the end plate your egg fried rice and garnish with the green part of the scallion.</li>
